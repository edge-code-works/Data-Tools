🛠️ Data Wrangling Scripts & Workarounds
Welcome to the Data Wrangling Scripts & Workarounds repo!

This repository is a curated collection of helpful scripts, clever workarounds, and creative hacks to manipulate, clean, transform, and prepare data across a wide range of scenarios in my career. Whether you're untangling messy spreadsheets, reformatting inconsistent datasets, or building quick fixes for ETL pipelines, this repo has your back. Of course, there are more than one way to do something so use what you want - I am just happy to share if I can! 

📦 What's Inside
You'll find an eclectic mix of:
Data cleaning scripts - Remove duplicates, standardize values, parse malformed text, and more.
File format converters - Tools to convert between CSV, JSON, Parquet, Excel, and other formats.
String parsing and regex helpers - Handle semi-structured text with smart extraction and transformation logic.
Date and time munging - Fix timezone issues, reformat timestamps, and align inconsistent time formats.
API interaction scripts - Quick scripts to pull data from APIs and normalize it for analysis.
Shell/data pipeline hacks - Lightweight CLI utilities and awk/sed/jq one-liners to make data behave.

🔧 Technologies Used
Depending on the script, this repo may include examples in:
R (tidyverse, lubridate, etc.)
JavaScript (Google Apps)
Python (pandas, numpy, json, etc.)
SQL (PostgreSQL / SQLite snippets)
